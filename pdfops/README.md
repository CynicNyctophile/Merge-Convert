# DocumentHandling
This is a project made of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node and Express JS. This repository contains the main index.html file, the server file and a merge file(which primarily 
helps in the internal PDF Merging Operation).

IMPORTANT:
Dependencies concerning the APIs and Node as well as Express have not been included in the repository and have to be downloaded separately.
Also there must be a MANDATORY 'public' and 'uploads' folder available for data dumping and picking. A different folder name can be chosen but the code needs to be modified
as such.

Local Hosting via nodemon/node can be done at host:3000.

The web application is a primary build providing 4 major file handling operations that can be further built upon with the help of the same or more APIs for further
development purposes.
